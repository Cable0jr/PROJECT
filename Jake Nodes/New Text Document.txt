You run down the dark hall with a few flickering lights, 
There appears to be cell like doors on each side of the hallway so you start to run faster.
The combo of you being scared and it being hard to see in the dark makes you unaware you've reached the end of the hallway, 
you smack hard into the wall tripping an alarm.
The cells slowly open one by one releasing horrifying, disfigured creatures alike to human but too disfigured to know for sure.
They all slowly walk toward you, now curled in a corner, you know you have to run or you'll be trapped.
You sprint to try and run between them as the are slowly moving towards you, and just as you are about to make it through
you trip, fall and you are now trapped in the middle of the large group. As the descend on you, the last sound you hear is
a garbled, muffled cry, then you feel the life leave your body...
