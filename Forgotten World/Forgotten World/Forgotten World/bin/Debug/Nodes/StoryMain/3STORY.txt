You have been given a briefing package for your mission.
You're the soldier that has the most experience in the group,
but you are not in charge, in fact, you are insulted that 
the lieutenant would put a lower rank in charge over you.
You think past that though, and decide to instead read
the briefing package...

the list of last documented inhabitants from 6 months ago,
